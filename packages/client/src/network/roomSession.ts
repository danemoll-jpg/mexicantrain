// Without this, a refresh mid-match wiped all in-memory React state (which room, which
// screen) with nothing to reconnect to: the host's browser refreshing to try to force a
// resync would instead get bounced back to the home screen with no way back in short of
// retyping a room code nobody had written down. Now a refresh — or reopening the tab days
// later — just re-subscribes to the same room and picks up wherever the match actually is.
