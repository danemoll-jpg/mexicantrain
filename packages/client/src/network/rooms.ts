//
// Room shape (Firestore doc at rooms/{code}):
//   {
//     createdAt: <ms epoch>,
//     hostClientId: <string>,
//     phase: "lobby" | "playing",
//     seats: [{ id, name, type: "human" | "bot", personality?, icon?, clientId: string | null }],
//     gameState: null | GameState,  // the full engine state, including every other player's
//       hidden hand — see the README's "Hand privacy" note: this is knowingly readable by
//       anyone with the room code, same trust model as Golf's/Durak's hidden-info handling.
//     commentary: [{ seq, speakerId, personality, text }],  // rolling window, newest last,
//       capped to COMMENTARY_LIMIT. Only ever appended by whoever just wrote a new
//       gameState (see useOnlineRoom) — sound cues, by contrast, are re-derived
//       independently and deterministically by every client straight from gameState.log.
//     nextCommentarySeq: <number>,  // monotonic, so every commentary entry gets a unique seq
//   }
// A seat with clientId === null and type "human" is an open seat — whoever calls joinRoom()
// next claims the first one they find.
